# wp-boilerplate

Wordpress theme boilerplate with npm and gulp

Clone the repo into your themes folder and `run npm install`.

To start working, run `gulp watch`, and run `gulp` to run the full build.

Add css files to concatinate in gulpfile.js, and add babel plugins to the .babelrc config file.

**Good to go!**
